# WhatsApp Desktop

WhatsApp desktop client, based on the official WhatsApp web app. Build with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).  

This is **NOT** an official product. This project does not attempt to reverse engineer the WhatsApp API or attempt to reimplement any part of the WhatsApp client. Any communication between the user and WhatsApp servers is handled by official WhatsApp Web itself; this is just a native wrapper for WhatsApp Web, like a browser.

## Features

* Cross platform. (OSX, Windows, Linux)  
* Native notifications.  
* System tray icon.  
* Open links in browser.  
* Badge with the number of notifications in the dock/taskbar.  
* Dock icon bounces when a new message is received.  
* Focus on contact search input via CMD+F (CTRL+F).  
* Transform commonly used emojis with CTRL + SPACE
* A couple of things can be configured:  
  * Toggle avatar visibility  
  * Toggle preview of the messages visibility
  * Ninja mode: display messages on mouse over  
  * Set the size for the media thumbs
